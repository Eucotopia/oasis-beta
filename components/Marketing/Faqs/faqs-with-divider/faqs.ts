            "不知道处于什么原因，我注销了陪伴自己多年的 qq 空间，同时清除了所有的动态（现在想想还是挺后悔的）。至此，我踏上了微信朋友圈之旅。不得不承认，起初朋友圈确实是一个好的地方，它在一定程度上成为了人们“talk”的平台。随着商业的侵蚀，朋友圈俨然称为各种广告的天下了。不过这并不是放弃朋友圈的真正原因，不知道从何时起发现，朋友圈已经无法成为聆听和欣赏的平台了，就像大制作的视频被短视频取代一样，这里充斥着没有营养的内容。所谓的营养并不是说我们的文字多么高深、我们的视频多么精细，而是它们应该是被细心雕琢的、有感而发的。因此，我产生了建立一个个人博客的想法，我想重新回到长文章、复杂文章的时代，哪怕没有一个人原因驻留10s.",
